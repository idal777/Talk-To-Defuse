## 🔌 Hardware Integration

The project is designed to work with the following hardware components:

- Arduino (Uno/Nano)  
- LED Matrix and RGB lights  
- Buzzer & sound alert systems  
- Buttons and switches  
- Accelerometer  
- Morse code module  
- Maze and lock systems  

Each module can be developed independently and integrated into the game box, resulting in a flexible system.
