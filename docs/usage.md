##  Setup

###  Hardware Requirements
-  **Arduino UNO** or compatible microcontroller  
-  **LED Modules** (for visual feedback)  
-  **Buttons** (for user inputs)  
-  **Buzzer** (for warning and alarm sounds)  
-  **Breadboard and jumper wires** (for easy connections)  

###  Software Requirements
-  **Arduino IDE** (to upload code)  
-  **Python** (optional, for module simulations)  

---

##  Starting Up

1.  Open the Arduino codes in the `code/` folder and upload them to the microcontroller using Arduino IDE.  
2.  Make hardware connections according to the [Basic Parts](essentialcomponents.md) guide.  
3.  Turn on the main moduleâ€™s power supply; the game will start automatically.  
4.  Follow the instructions shown in the terminal or serial monitor and start playing.

##  Gameplay

-  Each **module** represents a unique task.  
-  Incorrect actions trigger the **buzzer** warning and a time penalty.  
-  Goal: Complete all modules correctly and defuse the bomb on time.  
-  Good communication and coordination are very important!

##  Tips and Strategies

-  **Simon Says Module:**  
  Carefully follow the color sequences and repeat them in the correct order. Mistakes mean penalties!  

-  **Morse Code Solution:**  
  Decode light and sound signals using the Morse code alphabetical table. Be patient!  

-  **Key Module:**  
  Turn the key in the correct order. Use trial and error to find the combination.  

-  **Time Management:**  
  Time is limited; make quick and accurate decisions.  

-  **Communication:**  
  Helper players should give clear and understandable instructions. Team harmony is the key to success!

##  Troubleshooting

-  **Module Not Responding:**  
  Check connections and power supply. Ensure the code is properly uploaded.  

-  **Sound or Light Not Working:**  
  Double-check buzzer and LED connections. The part might be faulty.  

-  **Coding Errors:**  
  Review error messages in Arduino IDE and verify libraries.
