- Clearly describe how the bug occurs  
- Include screenshots if possible

### 2. Suggest New Features  
Got an idea for a new module or game feature?

- Write a brief but clear description  
- Specify the type of hardware or software needed  
- Explain why it would be useful

### 3. Contribute Code  
If you want to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository  
2. Create a new branch (e.g. `feature/led-module`)  
3. Make your improvements  
4. Test your code  
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

For code contributions:

- Keep your code readable  
- Add comments if necessary  
- Prefer meaningful commit messages instead of one large commit

### 4. Write Documentation  
Documentation is as valuable as code. You can help by:

- Updating files like `faq.md` or `about.md`  
- Writing usage guides for new modules  
- Adding beginner-friendly setup guides

---

###  Module Development Rules

- Each module should work independently  
- Input/output pins must be specified inside the `README.md`  
- Include tested circuit diagrams  
- Organize code logically inside the `src/` folder

---

##  Pull Request Guidelines

- Please write a brief description for each PR  
- For major changes, opening an Issue beforehand is recommended  
- Your code should not break other components
