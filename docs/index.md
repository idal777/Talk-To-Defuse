## 🚀 What is the Project?

**Talk to Defuse** is a physical bomb defusal game that gamifies teamwork, communication, and engineering skills.  
While some players try to defuse the bomb, others provide remote instructions. The project is fully open-source and based on Arduino.

🎯 **Our Goal:**  
To bring together makers, students, and game enthusiasts by offering a fun and educational experience.

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

📦 The system consists of **modules** physically connected to each other. Each is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller and connected to the main module via the I2C protocol.

🧩 Game Process:  
1. ⏱️ The main module starts the timer and sets the number of active modules  
2. 🔄 Modules activate and tasks begin  
3. 🔌 Players interact with modules and try to solve problems  
4. 💬 The assisting player communicates instructions  
5. 🎉 If the bomb is defused in time, the team wins
