# Getting Started

This project is an interactive bomb defusal game based on Arduino with physical modules.

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno  
- USB Cable  
- Basic components like LEDs, buzzers, buttons  
- A computer (Windows / Linux / Mac)  

## Setup

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE.  
2. Install the required libraries.  
3. Open the `main.ino` file and upload it to your Arduino board.  

## Before Starting Gameplay

- Make sure all modules are properly connected.  
- Verify that the LEDs are blinking correctly on each module.  
- Confirm that buttons and buzzers respond as expected.  
- Check the power supply and USB connection for stability.

 **Tip:**  
Always double-check wiring before powering the system to avoid hardware damage. Test each module individually if possible to ensure proper operation before starting the game.
